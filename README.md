Got it ✅ — here’s a **professional, hackathon-grade `README.md`** for your BlockDAG project. It’s structured to hit **all hackathon requirements**, showcase the **tech stack clearly**, and present your project as **polished, serious, and innovative**. I also included the **BlockDAG Hackathon Rules** section exactly as required.

# 🔮 Prediction Vaults  
_A BlockDAG Hackathon Project_

[Live Demo](https://vaults-psi.vercel.app/)  

---

## 📌 Overview

**Prediction Vaults** is a decentralized prediction platform designed and deployed for the **BlockDAG Hackathon**.  

It allows anyone to create or join **on-chain prediction vaults** on real-world events and built-in games.  
Participants stake tokens, make predictions, and winners claim rewards from the vault pools — all powered by **BlockDAG’s scalable testnet infrastructure**.  

This project is built to highlight how **BlockDAG’s high-throughput, EVM-compatible chain** can power **real-time dApps** with fairness, security, and fun.  

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🏦 **Vault Factory** — deploy new vaults dynamically on BlockDAG.  
- 🎮 **Mini-games integration** — included prediction-based games to test the mechanics.  
- 🔐 **On-chain transparency** — all vault logic and results stored on BlockDAG.  
- 💸 **Reward mechanism** — winners claim directly from the vault contract.  
- ⚡ **Fast & scalable** — leveraging BlockDAG’s DAG-based architecture.  
- 🖥️ **Modern UI/UX** — minimal, responsive interface for smooth interaction.

## 🔗 Smart Contracts

* **Factory Vault Address**:
  `0xca9c7C06dCb426f37Ab01Ce8Ba3C83fbB01d32Da`

Contracts are deployed on **BlockDAG testnet**.
Verified source code and interactions available through the BlockDAG explorer.

---

## 🧪 Development Workflow

1. **Hardhat** used for contract compilation, testing, and deployment.
2. **Next.js API routes** handle backend logic and contract calls.
3. **Ethers.js** manages wallet connections and vault interactions.
4. **Environment variables** stored in `.env` (never hardcoded).
5. **Unit tests** ensure vault logic security and prevent exploit vectors.

## 🎥 Demo

* **Live Application**: [vaults-psi.vercel.app](https://vaults-psi.vercel.app/)
* **Screenshots & Video Demo**: Included in submission (2–5 minutes).

## 📝 BlockDAG Hackathon Rules

Welcome to the BlockDAG Hackathon, hosted on [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)!
This section outlines the official rules, requirements, and judging criteria.

### 🧾 General Rules

* **Eligibility**: Open to individuals 18 years or older. Teams may consist of 1–5 participants.
* **Original Work**: All projects must be started and completed during the official hackathon period. Pre-existing code must be declared.
* **Code of Conduct**: All participants must adhere to the [HackerEarth Code of Conduct](https://www.hackerearth.com/code-of-conduct/).

### 🧠 Submission Requirements

1. **GitHub Repository** — must include a public repo with README, install steps, usage, license.
2. **Working Demo** — live or recorded video (2–5 minutes).
3. **Pitch Deck** (optional but recommended).
4. **Deployed Smart Contracts** — deployed to BlockDAG testnet, with addresses shared.

### 🔐 Smart Contract Best Practices

* Use Solidity `^0.8.0` or higher.
* Include test suite (Hardhat, Foundry, or Truffle).
* Avoid hardcoding secrets; use `.env`.
* Cover all state-changing functions with tests.

### 📊 Judging Criteria
